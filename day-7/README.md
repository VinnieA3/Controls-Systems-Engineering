# Day 7 – Extended Metrics Collection

This day builds on Days 4–6.  
The idea: go beyond basic load/memory by collecting **multiple metrics** (CPU, disk, network).

Right now, this folder has a placeholder collector script.  
Next steps: add richer monitoring commands (e.g., `vmstat`, `iostat`, `df`, `ifconfig`) and parse their outputs.
